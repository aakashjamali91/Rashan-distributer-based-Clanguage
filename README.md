📦 Disaster Rashan DistributorA professional C++
Software designed to manage disaster relief distribution efficiently, securely, and transparently.
📖 About The ProjectDisaster Rashan Distributor is a desktop application built to help NGOs and Government bodies manage the distribution of food and financial aid during disasters.Instead of using paper records, this software creates a secure Digital Ledger. It automatically decides who is eligible for aid based on their income and job status, ensuring that help reaches the people who need it most.
🎯 PurposeThis project was developed as a Semester Project for the Programming Fundamentals course (BSCS-25F). The goal was to demonstrate how C++ and Graphics can be used to solve real-world problems like disaster management.

✨ Key FeaturesThis software is packed with professional features:
📝 Smart Registration SystemAuto-Calculation: You simply enter the applicant's Income, and the software automatically assigns the correct Ration Package:Income < 20k: Eligible for 30k Rashan.Income < 50k: Eligible for 20k Rashan.Income < 80k: Eligible for 10k Rashan.Bonus Logic: If the applicant is a Government Employee (Grade 3-16), the system adds a special Bonus Bag.
📊 Analytics Dashboard (New!)Visual Graphs: View professional bar charts that show real-time data:Distribution Status: See how many people have received aid vs. how many are pending.Job Ratio: See the percentage of Government vs. Private applicants.Budget Estimator: The dashboard automatically calculates the Total Estimated Cost required for all registered applicants.3.
